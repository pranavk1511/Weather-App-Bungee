### Notes
- Ensure your OpenWeather API plan includes **historical weather data access**.
- If you get a `401 Unauthorized` error, check your API key and subscription level.
- Modify the CSS in `WeatherApp.css` for further customization.
- **If there are multiple cities with the same name, you need to mention the country or state to avoid ambiguity.**
